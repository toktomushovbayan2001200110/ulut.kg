A tool to show your products’ brands, generate reliability and guarantee the quality of your products.


== Description ==

71% of users that buy online say that it is essential for them to recognize a brand before making a purchase.

Showing known brands in your shop has many advantages both for you and for your customers, especially in an online store, where quality cannot be “touched” and a product might be easily under- or overestimated. Not only do well-known brands attract customers and grant more visibility, but they will make your customers feel much more confident when buying, because the brand itself is a guarantee of quality.

With this plugin you can create unlimited brands, upload logos and show them in product pages to help customers easily find products of their favorite brands.
